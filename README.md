# Dotfiles
This repo stores my dotfiles for my linux setup, currently it has dotfiles for zsh, neovim, and kitty

## Usage
Use the init.sh script to initialize your dot files. This ensures only the directories needed are symlinked and others represent the filestructure
Make sure you have gnu stow installed before running this
