# Dotfiles
This repo stores my dotfiles for my linux setup, currently it has dotfiles for zsh, neovim, and kitty

## Usage
Use the init.sh script to initialize your dot files. This ensures only the directories needed are symlinked and others represent the filestructure
Make sure you have gnu stow installed before running this

### Picom
To set up picom use [this](https://github.com/fdev31/picom) repo here and compile it. Any other fork of picom wont work with the animations

## pacmanfile
pacmanfile is a system to declaratively download all the packages needed to run the system
Once you set up the dotfiles repo, it is a good idea to install
